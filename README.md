# FnFSS2PNG
Converts a Friday Night Funkin' Spritesheet to a collection of image sequences. Each seperate animation will be outputted to its own folder.

## How do I use this thing?
When running this program, it will prompt you to load your PNG/XML spritesheet. For the spritesheet you want to target, the PNG and XML file of it **must** be in the same folder.
As obvious, select your PNG/XML (it doesn't matter which one), and it will generate a folder in the same directory of the PNG/XML with folders containing image sequences of each animation.

### Important!
Currently, this program will only export
- The first 20 frames of any arrow animation
- The first 40 frames of all animations but the above

### Also important!
The only way to close this program (unless it closes itself, e.g. when it is done converting it will exit) is by opening up task manager and closing it through that mehod.
